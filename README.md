#Charater Game 

This game was a project to better understand react. It is a simple game that the user should only click every picture once. If they click on a picture twice the game will start over. The cards are made from a json file that then react imports and builds the cards from. The cards all behave the same and this give room to add a json with any number of items so long as if follow the correct format. It is a simple web page but was fun to make.
